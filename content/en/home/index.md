The Dekatrian Calendar aims to simplify and improve the human relationship with time, while solving many problems and difficulties of the current Gregorian calendar. It is a solar calendar containing 13 months with exactly 28 days, or 4 perfect weeks. So every 1st of every month always falls on the same day of the week, synchronizing those two cycles (weeks and months) that are the most important in everyday use.

The names of the months are inspired by natural elements, seeking a more universal character to the calendar, and are ordered alphabetically, bringing more synergy and ease of assimilation. A Dekatrian year begins in the month of Aur√≥ran (the dawn, the sunrise, the beginning of a cycle) and ends in the month of Nixian (the night, the sunset, the end of the cycle). In total there are 13 months starting in A, B, C, D, ... L, M and N, followed by a special day that is not part of any month, the Acronia, whose function is to synchronize the calendar with the solar cycle.

The Dekatrian calendar allows you to plan appointments without having to look at an agenda; simplifies the accounting of days worked, vacations and payments; it is synchronized with the menstrual cycle, being a tool for a body/physiological self-understanding; it grants the human being a perception and integration with that which is one of the most important magnitudes of the universe: **time**.
